"""HOPE: the one calibration statistic that cannot be recovered offline.

arXiv 2609.18916 shows REAP is a special case of HOPE with the interaction terms zeroed, and at
40-50% pruning -- our forced ratio -- HOPE beat REAP in EVERY agentic experiment (mean +2.8%, up
to +6.1%) on a model with MiMo's exact shape (256 experts, top-8, 48 MoE layers).

    F[i,j] = (1/|X_ij|) * sum over tokens where BOTH i,j routed of  g_i*||f_i|| * g_j*||f_j||
    prune-set = argmin_p  p^T F p   s.t.  p in {0,1}^E,  sum(p) = n_prune

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE CRITERION WORK. Every criterion in the unified family
of arXiv 2606.15716 -- Frequency (0,0,0), SEER (0,1,0), EAN (0,0,1), REAP (1,1,1), MAN (1,0,1),
MSAN (1,0,2), and the task-specific winners (0,1,1) and (0,2,2) -- is already computable offline
from the per-expert accumulators the saliency pass keeps (`sum`, `sq`, `nrm`, `nsq`, `gat`,
`cnt`). They can all be re-derived after the fact, for free, as often as we like.

The off-diagonal of F cannot. It needs the per-token CO-ACTIVATION structure, which no
per-expert accumulator retains. Miss it in the pass and the only way back is another full
forward pass over the whole calibration corpus. That is what makes this the single step with a
deadline.

Cost: for MiMo (47 MoE layers, 256 experts) the accumulators are 47*256*256*8 B * 2 = 49.3 MB,
and the per-token work is one 8x8 outer product of values the expert loop already computes.
